"""## Summary:

## Cost and Profitability Analysis Summary

### 1. Q&A

**Q: Which features are most important in predicting the total order value?**

**A:** According to the feature importance analysis of the trained RandomForestRegressor model, 'Order Value' is the most important feature, followed by 'Delivery Fee', 'Order Hour', and 'Order DayOfWeek'. Payment methods and 'Peak Hours' had a minimal impact on predicting the total order value.


### 2. Data Analysis Key Findings

* **Missing Values:** The 'Discounts and Offers' column had 185 missing values, which were filled with 0.
* **Outlier Handling:** Outliers were identified and handled by capping the 'Order Value', 'Delivery Fee', and 'Commission Fee' at the 99th percentile.
* **Feature Engineering:** New features were engineered based on 'Order Date and Time', including 'Order Hour', 'Order DayOfWeek', 'Peak Hours', 'Meal Type', and 'Total Order Value'. Dummy variables were created for 'Payment Method', and restaurants were segmented based on average total order value.
* **Model Performance:** The trained RandomForestRegressor model achieved an R-squared of 0.998 on the test set, with a relatively low MSE (554.28) and RMSE (23.54), indicating strong performance in predicting the total order value.
* **Feature Importance:** 'Order Value' was the most important feature in predicting 'Total Order Value', followed by 'Delivery Fee', 'Order Hour', and 'Order DayOfWeek'.


### 3. Insights or Next Steps

* **Focus on Order Value and Delivery Fee:** Since 'Order Value' and 'Delivery Fee' are the most influential features for predicting total order value, optimizing these aspects could have a significant impact on profitability.
* **Further Explore Temporal Patterns:**  Analyze the impact of 'Order Hour' and 'Order DayOfWeek' on total order value, identify peak order times, and optimize pricing or promotional strategies accordingly.
* **Investigate Restaurant Segmentation:** Explore if different restaurant segments (High, Medium, Low) have varying profitability and refine strategies based on these segments.
